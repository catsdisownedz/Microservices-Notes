### Dependency related issues
- I had some trouble with setting up the dependencies using Intellij Ultimate. Their versions were incorrect or the dependency in itself was incompatible with the IDE
- for XML, this dependency worked: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/jakarta.xml.bind/jakarta.xml.bind-api/4.0.2
- Turns out the JSON dependency was outdated, looked for the newer version and it worked
- When in doubt, reload maven project! Especially if a dependency seems to have no reason not to be working. `right click -> maven -> reload project` [The website that helped me discover this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62313538/how-to-solve-java-package-com-opencsv-does-not-exist-in-maven-with-intellij)
